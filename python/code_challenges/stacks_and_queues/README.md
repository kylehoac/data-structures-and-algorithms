# Challenge Summary

Write a psuedoqueue class that only has the methods enqueue, and dequeue, and uses two stacks internally. The two stacks may only have the push, pop, and peek methods

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

Time complexity is O(N) because worst case scenario, you have to do an operation for each item in the queue

Space Complexity is O(N) because as the number of inputs increases, the memory required to store them increases linearly with the number of inputs

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
