# Trees

__*Challenge15*__
Create a function that takes in a valu and adds a new node in the correct location of a binary search tree

__*Challenge16*__
Create a function that can find the maximum value inside of a binary tree

## Challenge

__*Challenge15*__
Create a binarysearchtree class that has a method named add that accepts a value and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree, and a method named contains that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

__*Challenge16*__
Write an instance method called find-maximum-value. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.
