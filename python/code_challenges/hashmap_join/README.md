# Hashmap LEFT JOIN
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Write a function called left join that takes 2 hash maps as arguments, and returns a data structure containing the key and value of the first hash map, as well as the value of the second hashmap if its key is contained within the first hashmap. If the key isnt found, then add "None" to the list in place of dictionary 2's value

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Iterate through two dictionaries, and add the key and value of dictionary 1 into a list. If dictionary 2 contains the same key, add its value to the list as well. If it does not contain the same key, add "None" to the list in place of dictionary 2's value. At the end return the list
